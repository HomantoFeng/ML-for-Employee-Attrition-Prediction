# ML-for-Employee-Attrition-Prediction
Supervised Learning for Employee Attrition Prediction

The goal of this project is to analyze the [HR department dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaisalqureshi/hr-analytics-and-job-prediction) and build predictive models to assess the likelihood of employee attrition. In addition, the project compares the performance of various models—balancing both accuracy and interpretability—to recommend the most effective approach for this task. Three models were built in this project: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest.
